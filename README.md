The sun was just a sleepy yawn of yellow, but Linnea was already humming. Not a fast song, but a slow, warm one, the kind that reminded her of Remy.

Remy’s favorite breakfast isn’t sweet or fancy, just the perfect, humble Salt Bread. Linnea pulled down the tall white bag of flour, the yeast packet, and a little jar of coarse, flaky sea salt.

Water, warm as a bath, met the yeast. Then the strong flour and a pinch of salt from the jar. Linnea worked the dough with her hands, pushing and pulling, until it was smooth and elastic, a living, breathing pillow.

“Rest now, little loaf,” she whispered, tucking the dough into a warm, cozy bowl with a clean cloth over it. The dough began its slow, secret magic, puffing up, saying, “Soon. Soon.”

While the dough was dreaming, Remy was stirring. He loved the mornings when the kitchen smells weren’t coffee or bacon, but something deeper, yeasty, and promising. He tiptoed out to see what Linnea was up to.

Linnea was already busy again. She punched the happy air out of the risen dough and shaped it quickly into two perfect, plump little canoes. Then, she took the flaky sea salt and scattered it across the tops like silver snow.

The oven door opened with a warm rush of air, waiting for its treasure. Linnea carefully slid the tray inside. The heat would work its loud, golden magic now.

Remy sat down with his newspaper, but he kept glancing at the oven. The smell grew stronger: toasted wheat, a hint of butter, and the sharp, lovely promise of the salt crust. It was the smell of being loved.

Ding! The bell sang. Linnea pulled them out—two loaves of sunshine, a deep, crackling gold. They cooled just enough to handle, singing a quiet, hungry song of tiny cracks on the crust.

Remy didn’t need to say thank you. He just took one, broke off the perfect, salty end piece, and gave the warm, center slice to Linnea. And that, more than anything, was their happy, homemade ‘I love you.’
